# Visual Inertial SLAM using Extended Kalman Filter

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on the methodology to implement Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the synchronized measurements provided from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a stereo camera. EKF prediction and update steps are implemented in this project to obtain the dead reckoning trajectory of the robot and to estimate the positions of landmarks observed during the path. The complete Visual-Inertial SLAM algorithm is then implemented combining the IMU prediction step and landmark update step to obtain updated trajectory of the robot. The results of the path followed by the robot in dead reckoning state, updated positions of the landmarks and updated robotâ€™s trajectory after Visual-Inertial SLAM for different number of features are presented in the report.
