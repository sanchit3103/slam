# Visual Inertial SLAM using Extended Kalman Filter


Details to run the code:

1) pr3_utils.py - Changes made in the file to include the x and y co-ordinates of the features and plot them along with the trajectory.

2) prediction_step.py - Contains the function definition to execute the IMU localization via EKF Prediction.

3) utility.py - Contains the definitions of all the functions written to support the main code.

4) main.py - This is the file which should be run to execute the code. This file contains the main loop executing EKF Prediction Step, EKF Update step for the landmarks and combined Visual SLAM algorithm.
