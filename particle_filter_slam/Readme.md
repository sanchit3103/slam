# Implementation of Particle Filter SLAM using Odometry, 2-D LiDAR Scans and Stereo Camera Measurements 

<p align="justify">
The project focuses on the methodology to implement Particle Filter SLAM using odometry data from encoders and Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG), 2-D LiDAR scans and stereo camera measurements. Particle Filter SLAM uses a set of particles to represent the vehicleâ€™s state. The particle representing the most accurate state of vehicle according to the map of environment is considered for localization. This cycle continues for all data points of sensors and the path covered by the vehicle. Mapping is performed using log-odds 2-D occupancy grid map. It is updated for every available scan data from LiDAR. The results of the path followed by the robot in dead reckoning state and after implementation of particle filter are presented in the report.
